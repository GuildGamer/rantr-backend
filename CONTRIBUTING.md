# Welcome to Rantr! ðŸŽ‰

We're thrilled to have you here! Rantr is a fantastic project that's all about ranting. Your contributions are what make this project shine, and we're excited to see what you can bring to the table.

## How Can I Contribute?

Contributing to Rantr is a piece of cake! Here's a quick guide to get you started:

### 1. Fork the Project

First things first, you'll need to create your own copy of the project. This is done by "forking" the project on GitHub. Here's how:

- [Click here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) to learn how to fork a repo.

### 2. Set Up Your Remote

Once you've forked the project, you'll need to set up a remote to your fork. This is where you'll push your changes. Here's the command to do that:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rantr-backend.git
git remote add base-project https://github.com/indie-hack-jos/rantr-backend.git
```

Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.

### 3. Create a New Branch

It's a good practice to create a new branch for each feature or bug fix you're working on. This keeps your work organized and separate from the main project. Here's how to create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Replace `your-branch-name` with a descriptive name for your branch.

### 4. Make Your Changes

Now it's time to dive in and make your changes! Remember to follow the project's coding standards and guidelines.

### 5. Commit and Push Your Changes

Once you're happy with your changes, it's time to commit them and push them to your fork. Here's how:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add a new feature"
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Replace `your-branch-name` with the name of your branch, and `Add a new feature` with a brief description of your changes.

### 6. Create a Pull Request

The final step is to create a pull request (PR) so that we can review your changes and potentially merge them into the main project. Here's how:

- [Click here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to learn how to create a PR.

### That's It!
